                <p>Descend to the Abyssal Abyss—an otherworldly chasm where bioluminescent creatures thrive. Here, ghostly lanternfish illuminate the darkness, and giant squid tentacles brush against the glass.

                <p>As you enter, the Coral Cathedral beckons—a vast, sun-drenched chamber adorned with vibrant coral formations. Rays of light pierce the water, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the sandy floor. Schools of neon tetras dart through the crevices, their iridescence rivaling the stained glass above.</p>
